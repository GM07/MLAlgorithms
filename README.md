# MLAlgorithms
Implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch for learning purposes. Numpy is the only dependency. Scikit-learn is used in the `example.py` file to compare the scikit-learn implementations with the custom made implementations. However, the library itself only depends on Numpy.
