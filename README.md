# MLAlgorithms
Implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch for learning purposes. Numpy is the only dependency. Scikit-learn is used in the `example.py` file to compare the scikit-learn implementations with the custom made implementations. However, the library itself only depends on Numpy.

# Requirements
- numpy (1.26.4)
- [Optional] : scikit-learn (1.5.1)

# Installation
Clone the project and use algorithms. The `example.py` file shows how to use the algorithms.

```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4

git clone git@github.com:GM07/MLAlgorithms.git
cd MLAlgorithms
```
